# How to Test Conversation Memory in Qwen Code

## Prerequisites
1. Ensure local-memori MCP server is running on http://localhost:4004/mcp
2. Run Qwen Code with: `qwen`

## Test Steps

### Step 1: Store a Conversation Turn
During your Qwen Code session, use the `store_conversation_turn` tool:

```json
{
  "user_input": "What is the capital of France?",
  "assistant_response": "The capital of France is Paris."
}
```

### Step 2: Store Another Conversation Turn
Use the `store_conversation_turn` tool again:

```json
{
  "user_input": "What is the population of Paris?",
  "assistant_response": "The population of Paris is approximately 2.2 million people."
}
```

### Step 3: Search Conversation History
Use the `search_conversation_history` tool to search for stored conversations:

```json
{
  "query": "France"
}
```

You should see results that include the conversation about the capital of France.

### Step 4: Test Session Isolation
1. Start a new Qwen Code session in a different terminal
2. Store a conversation turn with different content:
   ```json
   {
     "user_input": "What is the tallest mountain in the world?",
     "assistant_response": "Mount Everest is the tallest mountain in the world."
   }
   ```
3. Search for "mountain" in this session - you should only see the Everest conversation
4. Search for "France" in this session - you should see no results (session isolation working)

### Step 5: Verify Session IDs
You can check the session ID by looking at the Qwen Code logs or by using the Memori extension's getSessionId() method in the code.

## Expected Results
1. Conversations are stored and retrieved correctly
2. Search results are relevant to the query
3. Different sessions don't see each other's conversations
4. Session isolation is maintained

## Troubleshooting
If the tools are not available:
1. Check that the local-memori server is running
2. Verify MCP server configuration in ~/.qwen/settings.json
3. Check Qwen Code logs for connection errors
