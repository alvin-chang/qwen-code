# Hanging Issue Fix Summary

## Problem
The Qwen application was hanging instead of showing the OAuth screen or proceeding with normal operation. This was caused by synchronous file operations in the ConversationManager that were blocking the main thread.

## Root Cause
Multiple synchronous file operations in the `ConversationManager` class were causing the application to hang:
1. `loadConversationId()` method was using `fs.readFileSync`
2. `storeConversationTurn()` method was using `fs.readFileSync` and `fs.writeFileSync`
3. `hasConversationHistory()` method was using `fs.readFileSync`

## Solution Implemented
Converted all synchronous file operations in the `ConversationManager` class to asynchronous operations:

1. **`loadConversationId()`**: Updated to `async loadConversationId()` using `fs.promises.readFile`
2. **`storeConversationTurn()`**: Updated to use `fs.promises.readFile` and `fs.promises.writeFile`
3. **`hasConversationHistory()`**: Updated to `async hasConversationHistory()` using `fs.promises.readFile`
4. **Updated client usage**: Made sure all calls to these methods properly await the promises
5. **Updated MemoriExtension**: Added static async `initialize()` method to properly handle async loading of conversation ID

## Files Modified
- `packages/core/src/conversation/conversation-manager.ts`
- `packages/core/src/core/client.ts`
- `packages/core/src/extensions/memori/memori-extension.ts`

## Verification
- Application no longer hangs on startup
- Conversation history is properly stored and retrieved
- Async file operations work correctly without blocking
- Build process completes successfully

## Result
The hanging issue has been resolved and the application now functions properly with conversation memory capabilities.
