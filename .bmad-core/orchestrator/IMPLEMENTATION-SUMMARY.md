   - Ensured consistency across both configuration files

### New Orchestrator Files

1. **`/bmad-core/orchestrator/config.js`**
   - Created dedicated configuration file for orchestrator settings
   - Defined detailed configuration for workflows, agents, monitoring, and more
   - Exported as a module for easy import

2. **`/bmad-core/orchestrator/index.js`**
   - Updated to export both the BMADOrchestrator class and orchestratorConfig
   - Provides a clean entry point for the orchestrator module

3. **`/bmad-core/orchestrator/package.json`**
   - Updated version to 2.1.0 to match the orchestrator version
   - Maintained existing dependencies and scripts

4. **`/bmad-core/orchestrator/README.md`**
   - Created comprehensive documentation for the orchestrator
   - Included features, usage instructions, and API reference

5. **`/bmad-core/orchestrator/API.md`**
   - Created detailed API documentation
   - Documented all core methods and usage examples

6. **`/bmad-core/orchestrator/orchestrator.test.js`**
   - Created basic test suite for the orchestrator
   - Tests instantiation, configuration, and core methods

7. **`/bmad-core/orchestrator/cli.js`**
   - Updated CLI interface for the orchestrator
   - Supports help, status, agents, and workflows commands

8. **`/bmad-core/orchestrator/example.js`**
   - Created example usage file
   - Demonstrates basic orchestrator functionality

9. **`/bmad-core/orchestrator/jest.config.js`**
   - Updated Jest configuration specific to the orchestrator
   - Configured coverage and test settings

### Modified Existing Files

1. **`/bmad-core/orchestrator/bmad-orchestrator.js`**
   - Updated to import and use the new configuration
   - Modified constructor to accept configuration parameter
   - Updated escalation path initialization to use configuration

## Key Features Implemented

### Configuration Management
- Centralized orchestrator configuration in dedicated files
- Consistent configuration across different parts of the system
- Extensible configuration structure for future enhancements

### Module Structure
- Clean module structure with proper exports
- Comprehensive documentation for users and developers
- Test suite for verifying functionality

### CLI Interface
- Simple command-line interface for basic orchestrator operations
- Support for help, status, agents, and workflows commands

### API Documentation
- Detailed API documentation with examples
- Clear method descriptions and usage guidelines

## Integration with Existing BMAD Framework

The orchestrator has been integrated with the existing BMAD framework in the following ways:

1. **Configuration Consistency**: The orchestrator configuration is now part of the main core-config.yaml files, ensuring consistency across the entire system.

2. **Memory Integration**: The orchestrator configuration includes settings for memory integration, ensuring proper coordination with the existing memory system.

3. **Module Structure**: The orchestrator follows the same module structure as other parts of the BMAD framework, making it easy to understand and extend.

4. **Testing**: The orchestrator includes a test suite that follows the same patterns as other tests in the BMAD framework.

## Future Considerations

1. **Enhanced Testing**: Expand the test suite to cover more edge cases and scenarios
2. **Additional Features**: Implement additional orchestrator features based on user feedback
3. **Performance Optimization**: Monitor and optimize orchestrator performance as it scales
4. **Documentation Updates**: Keep documentation up-to-date as features evolve

## Conclusion

The BMAD™ Orchestrator has been successfully integrated into the existing BMAD framework with proper configuration management, documentation, and testing. The implementation follows established patterns and conventions, making it easy to maintain and extend.
