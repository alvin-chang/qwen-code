# BMAD™ Orchestrator Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide provides instructions for implementing and extending the BMAD™ Orchestrator system. The orchestrator consists of five core modules that work together to manage multi-agent workflows, coordinate agent interactions, monitor performance, manage resources, and handle escalations.

## Architecture

The orchestrator follows a modular architecture with the following components:

1. **WorkflowManager** - Manages workflow lifecycles
2. **AgentCoordinator** - Coordinates agent interactions
3. **PerformanceMonitor** - Monitors system performance
4. **ResourceManager** - Manages resource allocation
5. **EscalationManager** - Handles issue escalations and conflict resolution

Each module is implemented as a separate JavaScript class in the `bmad-core/orchestrator/` directory.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Setting Up the Environment

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- BMAD™ Core library

### 2. Creating Orchestrator Modules

Each orchestrator module should be implemented as a separate class with clearly defined responsibilities:

1. Create a new file in `bmad-core/orchestrator/` for each module
2. Implement the module's core functionality
3. Integrate with existing utilities (WorkflowMonitor, MermaidGenerator, MemoryAnalytics)
4. Add memory integration using appropriate prefixes
5. Write unit tests for the module

### 3. Memory Integration

All orchestrator activities should be stored in the memory system with appropriate prefixes:

- Workflow activities: `ORCH:WORKFLOW:`
- Agent coordination: `ORCH:AGENT:`
- Resource management: `ORCH:RESOURCE:`
- Escalations and conflicts: `ORCH:ESCALATION:`

Use the `store_memory` function to store information:

```javascript
store_memory({
  agent_role: 'ORCHESTRATOR',
  project_id: process.env.PROJECT_ID || 'default',
  content: 'ORCH:WORKFLOW: Created new workflow'
});
```

### 4. Command Implementation

Implement orchestrator commands by creating functions that interact with the appropriate modules. Commands should:

1. Validate input parameters
2. Execute the requested operation
3. Handle errors appropriately
4. Store relevant information in memory
5. Return appropriate responses

### 5. Testing

Write comprehensive tests for each orchestrator module:

1. Unit tests for individual functions
2. Integration tests for module interactions
3. End-to-end tests for complete workflows
4. Performance tests for scalability

## Extending the Orchestrator

To extend the orchestrator with new functionality:

1. Identify the appropriate module to extend or create a new module
2. Implement the new functionality following the existing patterns
3. Add memory integration with appropriate prefixes
4. Create new commands if needed
5. Write tests for the new functionality
6. Update documentation

## Best Practices

1. **Modularity**: Keep modules focused on specific responsibilities
2. **Memory Integration**: Store all significant activities in memory with appropriate prefixes
3. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling
4. **Testing**: Write tests for all functionality
5. **Documentation**: Keep documentation up to date with implementation changes
6. **Performance**: Optimize for performance, especially in monitoring and visualization components
