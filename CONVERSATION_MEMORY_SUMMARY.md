# Qwen Code Persistent Conversation Memory System

## Overview

The Qwen Code project already includes a fully implemented persistent conversation memory system with session isolation capabilities. This system allows for storing and retrieving conversation history across different sessions while maintaining proper isolation between different conversations.

## Architecture Components

### 1. ConversationManager (`packages/core/src/conversation/conversation-manager.ts`)

The core storage system that handles:
- Conversation ID generation and management
- File-based storage in `.qwen/conversations/` directory
- Session ID generation and management
- Local storage and retrieval of conversation turns
- Search functionality with query filtering

### 2. MemoriExtension (`packages/core/src/extensions/memori/memori-extension.ts`)

The main extension class that provides:
- High-level API for conversation memory operations
- Integration with the ConversationManager
- Session and conversation ID management
- Methods for storing and searching conversation history

### 3. Tools Implementation

#### Store Conversation Tool (`packages/core/src/extensions/memori/conversation-memory-tool.ts`)
- Tool name: `store_conversation_turn`
- Parameters: `user_input`, `assistant_response`, `conversation_id`, `session_id`
- Functionality: Stores conversation turns with proper conversation and session context

#### Search Conversation Tool (`packages/core/src/extensions/memori/search-conversation-tool.ts`)
- Tool name: `search_conversation_history`
- Parameters: `query`, `conversation_id`, `session_id`, `limit`
- Functionality: Searches conversation history with filtering and result limiting

### 4. Tool Manager (`packages/core/src/extensions/memori/memori-tool-manager.ts`)

Handles the registration of conversation memory tools with the tool registry system.

## Storage Implementation

The system stores conversation data in a file-based approach:

- **Conversation IDs**: Stored in `.qwen/conversation-id` per directory
- **Conversation Data**: Stored in `.qwen/conversations/{conversationId}.json`
- **Format**: JSON array of conversation turns with metadata

Each conversation turn includes:
- `userInput`: The user's input text
- `assistantResponse`: The assistant's response text
- `conversationId`: The conversation identifier
- `sessionId`: The session identifier
- `timestamp`: When the conversation turn occurred

## Session Isolation

The system implements proper session isolation through:

1. **Unique Session IDs**: Each conversation session gets a unique identifier
2. **Conversation Context**: Multiple sessions can participate in the same conversation
3. **Search Filtering**: Search results can be filtered by both conversation and session IDs
4. **Directory-Based Context**: Each project directory maintains its own conversation context

## Testing and Verification

The system includes comprehensive testing:

1. **Unit Tests**: Located in `packages/core/src/extensions/memori/memori-extension.test.ts`
2. **Integration Test**: `test-conversation-storage.js` verifies the complete functionality
3. **Verification Scripts**: `verify-conversation-memory.sh` checks the complete setup

## Usage in Qwen Code

The conversation memory system is integrated into Qwen Code through:
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) extension registration
- Automatic tool registration when MCP servers connect
- Integration with the main tool registry system

## Current Status

✅ **Fully Implemented**: All components are complete and functional
✅ **Persistent Storage**: Conversations are stored to disk and persist between sessions
✅ **Session Isolation**: Proper isolation between different sessions and conversations
✅ **Search Functionality**: Ability to search through stored conversation history
✅ **Test Coverage**: Automated tests verify system functionality
✅ **File-based Storage**: Simple, reliable storage system using JSON files
✅ **MCP Integration**: Properly integrated with the Model Context Protocol system

## Implementation Verification

The test script confirms that:
1. Conversation IDs are properly stored and retrieved
2. Conversation turns can be successfully stored to persistent storage
3. Stored conversation turns can be successfully retrieved through search
4. Conversation files are created in the correct directory structure
5. Data is properly formatted and accessible

## Conclusion

The enhanced BMAD orchestrator for Qwen Code already has a complete and functional persistent conversation memory system. The implementation provides all the required capabilities including persistent storage, session isolation, and search functionality. The system is production-ready and working correctly across all components.
